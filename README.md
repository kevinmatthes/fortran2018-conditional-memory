This library is written in Fortran 2018 such that its build requires a compiler
supporting this standard.  This project relies on **GFortran** therefore.

The library build is organised with **Just**.  The corresponding `.justfile`
does not only take care for the compilation of the library but also for its
documentation and testing.

The documentation is generated by **Doxygen**.  The configured output formats
are listed in the following.

* HTML
* LaTeX
* UNIX manual pages

In order to finalise the LaTeX documentation, an appropriate LaTeX distribution
is required.  A *full* installation of **TeX Live** is recommended.  This
project employs **Latexmk** as LaTeX build manager for the manual finalisation.

In order to simplify the maintenance, **bump2version** as well as **Scriv** are
used to automate the release generation.  Scriv will compile the changelog on
release after all version numbers were incremented by bump2version.

Build artifacts are prevented from begin committed by the `.gitignore` this
repository contains.  It furthermore controls which files are going to be
removed by `git clean`.  Thus, it is the simplest solution to employ **Git** for
the removal of build artifacts.

## Description

This repository provides the source code for a library named `libf18cndmem.a`.
The purpose of this library is the conditional allocation and deallocation of
allocatable objects of Fortran intrinsic types.  It is written in Free Form
Fortran 2018.

As the deallocation of an allocatable object which is not already allocated will
result in a runtime error, it needs to be checked whether the object to
deallocate is allocated at all.  The deallocation subroutines this library
provides will take care about this check.  All those subroutines are exposed
with the generic interface `cnddel` which is an abbreviation of
"**C**o**nd**itional **De**a**l**location".  At the moment, the following types
are supported:

* `character` (default)

* `character` (default)

## Build

The build routine is organised by Just and defined in the `.justfile` in the
repository root.  To build the library, one of the following instructions can
be executed.

```bash
just b
just build
just l
just library
```

In addition, an automatic source code documentation with Doxygen is configured.
One of the following commands will invoke the compilation.

```bash
just d
just doxygen
```

If the compilation of both the library and its documentation is wished, the
following instructions can be executed.

```bash
just
just a
just all
```
